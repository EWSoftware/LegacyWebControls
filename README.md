This contains a set of legacy ASP.NET web controls that I developed many years ago.  I never published them
publicly.  They were mainly for personal use and for use at work.  Use them as you see fit.  Just bear in mind
that there are probably better controls out there now.

The demo makes use of the [Common Web Page Library](https://github.com/EWSoftware/CommonWebPageLibrary).

No support will be provided for these controls.
